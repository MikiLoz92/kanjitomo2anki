This is a simple application that extracts vocabulary from any file outputted by [Kanjitomo](https://www.kanjitomo.net/), in its standard format, and creates a new [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck with all the words contained in it, so that you can study it later.

# Usage
Download the source code and execute the following on the root folder:
```shell
chmod +x kanjitomo2anki
./kanjitomo2anki ./path/to/vocabularyfile.txt
```
